# Accessibility Decision

## Context and Problem Statement

As mentioned in FirebaseUsage.md, we have decided on using Firebase for website hosting. The frequency of deployment was something that needed to be discussed.

## Considered Options

* Deploy after each minor changes is made
* Deploy after each milestone is completed

## Decision Outcome
We eventually decided to use Netlify to see minor changes, and use Firebase to host the final website. Will deploy after each milestone is completed.
