# Merging

## Context and Problem Statement

Each merge introduces the possibility of new bugs or conflicts, especially if the changes being merged are significant or complex. Merging too frequently can increase the risk of introducing new bugs or destabilizing the codebase.

## Considered Options

* Establishing guidelines for how frequently changes should be merged

## Decision Outcome

- We will merge once a week together (either before the meeting or during the meeting).
- Use Visual Studio Code live server to view minor changes from our own code/branch before merging.
